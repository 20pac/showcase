        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I usually use <span class="highlight">JavaScript</span> for making my
          applications, but learning a new technology is not a problem at all. I
          have good grasp over the JavaScript language, including the newer
          specifications. I have a good working knowledge of, and have done
          several projects using the technologies in the
          <span class="highlight">MERN</span> stack. I have experience with the
          <span class="highlight">React.js</span> library, and the
          <span class="highlight">Redux</span> workflow. I also have experience
          in using <span>Node</span> and
          <span class="highlight">Express</span> together to make
          <span class="highlight">RESTful APIs</span>, and integrating them with
          the client side, made using React.js. I have graduated in
          <span class="highlight"
            >Computer Science from BITS Pilani, Goa Campus</span
          >, and have strong grasp of the fundamentals of computing.
